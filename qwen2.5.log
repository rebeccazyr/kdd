Note: The relationship between "Information systems" and "Networks" is a bit ambiguous as "Information systems" can be considered a broader category that includes "Networks". However, for the purpose of this taxonomy, I've listed "Information systems" as a subtopic of "Networks". If you prefer a different relationship, please let me know.

Note: Some concepts like "Information systems" and "Information systems applications" are not directly hierarchical but related. In a taxonomy, they can be placed at the same level or one can be a broader category. Here, I've placed "Information systems" as a root category and "Information systems applications" as a subtopic under it.

chikhirtma is a subtopic of soup; sour rye soup is a subtopic of chikhirtma; talunan is a subtopic of soup; cold borsch is a subtopic of soup; dalithoy is a subtopic of soup; bisque is a subtopic of soup; crème ninon is a subtopic of bisque; pottage is a subtopic of soup

Note: "bisque" and "crème ninon" are typically not directly related to "soup" in a culinary taxonomy, but for the purpose of this exercise, I have included them under "soup". "Chikhirtma" is a traditional Mongolian dish, often served as a soup, and "sour rye soup" is a specific type of chikhirtma. "Talunan" is a type of soup from the Caucasus region. "Cold borsch" is a variation of borsch, which is typically a hot soup. "Dalithoy" is a type of soup from the Maldives.

food is the parent for:
- pecans (a type of seed)
- wheat (a type of grain, not a seed but often categorized with them)
- pine nuts (a type of seed)
- frozen yoghurt (a type of frozen dessert)
- mixed nuts (a category that can include various nuts)
- macadamia nuts (a type of nut)
- cereals (a category of food)
- grits (a food made from ground corn)
- seeds (a broader category that includes pecans, pine nuts, and soy nuts)
- bakery (a category of food)
- soup (a category of food)
- walnuts (a type of nut)
- frozen dessert (a category that includes frozen yoghurt)
- dairy product (a category of food, not directly related to the nuts and seeds)
- beverage (a category of food)
- chestnuts (a type of nut)
- soy nuts (a type of seed)
- rye (a type of grain, not a seed but often categorized with them)
- meat (a category of food)

Note: Some items like "bakery" and "beverage" are broader categories that can contain many different types of food items, while others like "dairy product" are more specific. "Wheat" and "rye" are grains, not seeds, but they are often grouped with seeds in food contexts.
