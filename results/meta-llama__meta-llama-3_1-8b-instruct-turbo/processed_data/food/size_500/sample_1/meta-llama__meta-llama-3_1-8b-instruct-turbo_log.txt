RAW OUTPUT FROM LLM

This is a very long list of concepts and relationships. I'll try to create a taxonomy for you, but it might not be perfect due to the sheer number of concepts.

Here's a possible taxonomy:

1. Food
   - 1.1. Meat
      - 1.1.1. Pork
      - 1.1.2. Beef
      - 1.1.3. Chicken
      - 1.1.4. Fish
   - 1.2. Vegetables
      - 1.2.1. Leafy Greens
      - 1.2.2. Root Vegetables
      - 1.2.3. Cruciferous Vegetables
   - 1.3. Fruits
      - 1.3.1. Citrus Fruits
      - 1.3.2. Berries
      - 1.3.3. Tropical Fruits
   - 1.4. Grains
      - 1.4.1. Cereals
      - 1.4.2. Bread
      - 1.4.3. Pasta
   - 1.5. Dairy
      - 1.5.1. Milk
      - 1.5.2. Cheese
      - 1.5.3. Yogurt
   - 1.6. Condiments
      - 1.6.1. Sauces
      - 1.6.2. Spices
      - 1.6.3. Herbs
   - 1.7. Beverages
      - 1.7.1. Soft Drinks
      - 1.7.2. Juice
      - 1.7.3. Coffee
      - 1.7.4. Tea
      - 1.7.5. Wine
      - 1.7.6. Beer
      - 1.7.7. Liquor

Here are some specific relationships:

- pasta is a subtopic of food

- occhi di lupo is a subtopic of pasta
- fuži is a subtopic of pasta
- corzetti is a subtopic of pasta
- mezzelune is a subtopic of pasta
