RAW OUTPUT FROM LLM
================================================================================
chikhirtma is a subtopic of soup; sour rye soup is a subtopic of chikhirtma; talunan is a subtopic of soup; cold borsch is a subtopic of soup; dalithoy is a subtopic of soup; bisque is a subtopic of soup; crème ninon is a subtopic of bisque; pottage is a subtopic of soup

Note: "bisque" and "crème ninon" are typically not directly related to "soup" in a culinary taxonomy, but for the purpose of this exercise, I have included them under "soup". "Chikhirtma" is a traditional Mongolian dish, often served as a soup, and "sour rye soup" is a specific type of chikhirtma. "Talunan" is a type of soup from the Caucasus region. "Cold borsch" is a variation of borsch, which is typically a hot soup. "Dalithoy" is a type of soup from the Maldives.
