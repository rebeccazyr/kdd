food is the parent for:
- pecans (a type of seed)
- wheat (a type of grain, not a seed but often categorized with them)
- pine nuts (a type of seed)
- frozen yoghurt (a type of frozen dessert)
- mixed nuts (a category that can include various nuts)
- macadamia nuts (a type of nut)
- cereals (a category of food)
- grits (a food made from ground corn)
- seeds (a broader category that includes pecans, pine nuts, and soy nuts)
- bakery (a category of food)
- soup (a category of food)
- walnuts (a type of nut)
- frozen dessert (a category that includes frozen yoghurt)
- dairy product (a category of food, not directly related to the nuts and seeds)
- beverage (a category of food)
- chestnuts (a type of nut)
- soy nuts (a type of seed)
- rye (a type of grain, not a seed but often categorized with them)
- meat (a category of food)
