RAW OUTPUT FROM LLM
================================================================================
Information accountability and usage control is a subtopic of Systems security; VLSI packaging is a subtopic of Hardware; Electronic design automation is a subtopic of Hardware; Design reuse and communication-based design is a subtopic of Design and analysis of algorithms; Design and analysis of algorithms is a subtopic of Theory of computation; Very large scale integration design is a subtopic of VLSI packaging; Application-specific VLSI designs is a subtopic of Very large scale integration design; Process control systems is a subtopic of Information systems applications; Hardware attacks and countermeasures is a subtopic of Security in hardware; Database and storage security is a subtopic of Security in hardware; Security in hardware is a subtopic of Systems security; Security and privacy is a subtopic of Systems security; Formal methods and theory of security is a subtopic of Security and privacy; Human and societal aspects of security and privacy is a subtopic of Security and privacy; Theory of computation is a subtopic of Computing Classification System; Information systems applications is a subtopic of Information systems; Computing Classification System is a root category

Note: Some concepts like "Information systems" and "Information systems applications" are not directly hierarchical but related. In a taxonomy, they can be placed at the same level or one can be a broader category. Here, I've placed "Information systems" as a root category and "Information systems applications" as a subtopic under it.
