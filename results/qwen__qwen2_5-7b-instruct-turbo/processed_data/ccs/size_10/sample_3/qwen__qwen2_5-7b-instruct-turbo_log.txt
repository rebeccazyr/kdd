RAW OUTPUT FROM LLM
================================================================================
Network services is a subtopic of Networks; Network properties is a subtopic of Networks; Embedded systems security is a subtopic of Security in hardware; Security in hardware is a subtopic of Security and privacy; Information systems is a subtopic of Networks; Network structure is a subtopic of Network architectures; Network architectures is a subtopic of Networks; Security and privacy is a subtopic of Computing Classification System; Computing Classification System is a parent topic to all the above subtopics. 

Note: The relationship between "Information systems" and "Networks" is a bit ambiguous as "Information systems" can be considered a broader category that includes "Networks". However, for the purpose of this taxonomy, I've listed "Information systems" as a subtopic of "Networks". If you prefer a different relationship, please let me know.
